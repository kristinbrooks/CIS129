CODING DECISIONS / UPDATES
________________________________________________
The original code got a name and number from the user and then told them
that their current run total was that number.

7/14/19 The code was edited to get the user's name, welcome them, and tell them
the goal of the game. Then the program asks the user for numbers and
keeps a running total of them. As soon as the sum of the numbers reaches 100
or the total number of numbers entered is 5 or greater, the program stops
asking for numbers and tells the user what their total for that run. Then it
asks if they want to play again until they say 'no' and then it tells them
the total of their highest run.
