STATUS / PROBLEMS
________________________________________________
The lab is complete and works as requested in the assignment
description. It also displays the same as the examples shown
in the assignment description.

The only problem I encountered was that after the first compile
I was booted out of my function with an error when I ran it.
The fix was easy. I looked at the line number in the error
message and saw that I had entered `NUM_MONTHS` into `months[]`
in my print lines instead of `subscript`. After fixing this
and recompiling everything worked as designed.
