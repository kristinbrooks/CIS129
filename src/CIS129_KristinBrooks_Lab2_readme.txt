CODING DECISIONS / UPDATES
________________________________________________
The original code asked the user for the cookie's name, asked if it
contained chocolate, and if it did contain chocolate the program told
them the cookie contained chocolate.

6/30/19 The code was edited to additionally find out if the cookie
contains gluten and peanut butter. Then it determines if the cookie
will be eaten or not. It will either display that it can't be eaten or
it will display a thank you message. The program no longer repeats the
the contents back to the user.
